# Machine Learning Model Training Platform

### Overview

The Machine Learning Model Training Platform is a user-friendly application designed to simplify the process of training machine learning models. It is specifically created for non-programmers and beginners in data science, providing an intuitive interface and automated model optimization features. This platform enables users to upload datasets, select algorithms, and train models without needing extensive coding knowledge.

### Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design to facilitate easy navigation and usability for non-programmers.
- **Automated Model Optimization:** Automatically tunes hyperparameters to achieve the best possible model performance.
- **Support for Various Algorithms:** Includes support for popular machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
- **Dataset Upload:** Allows users to upload datasets in CSV format for model training.
- **Model Evaluation:** Provides detailed performance metrics and visualizations to help users understand model accuracy and effectiveness.
- **Export Trained Models:** Users can export trained models in H5 format for deployment or further analysis.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database:** CSV files for storing user data and model configurations
- **Model Export:** H5 files for saving trained models
